EdgeJs, Scriptcs, MsSql, NodeJs

C# source code compiled by EdgeJS
Extensions .cs should be .csx but OmniSharp doesn't like it.
OmniSharp complains about bad directive @'#load "something", But I Can live with that.
And not so much with just the scriptcs compiler feedback.
OmmiSharp in Sublime needs a .sln file, that is NOT in source control.
Same with the .csproj file
script.csx is there  to be run by scriptcs , not by edge, not by node
Serializer.csx is there to be used as .Dump() in console , not by edge, not by node
